## About
- This adventure is designed to have drastic consequences, capable of significantly altering the world and the player characters. For this reason, it is ideally suited to be run as a one-shot (a single-session adventure). However, with the proper adjustments, it can be adapted into an ongoing campaign by GMs who wish to explore its long-term ramifications.
- The encounters and challenges in this adventure have been designed and balanced for a standard party of four adventurers. Feel free to adjust the difficulty of the encounters for larger or smaller parties by consulting the encounter balancing guidelines presented in the Core Rulebook.
